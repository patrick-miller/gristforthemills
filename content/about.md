<div style="margin-bottom:1rem;">
I am the Director of Machine Learning at [Macmillan](https://us.macmillan.com/) where I use machine learning to enhance the book publishing process. I have been a key contributor to [Cognoma](https://github.com/cognoma), a cancer genomics ML research tool, and I built [Forecastaer](http://www.forecastaer.com/), a real-time air quality prediction and visualization web app.
